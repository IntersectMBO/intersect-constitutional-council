However, the Council has ruled that treasury withdrawals must be given to someone they like and 2 of them are not Rihanna fan , the rest who are fans are upset she hasn't released an album in years.",

      "counterargumentDiscussion": "One possible counterargument could be that the expansion of the Cardano ecosystem via high-profile marketing campaigns, such as one involving a celebrity like Rihanna, could provide substantial long-term value to the ecosystem.However the Council do not approve of Rihanna as a beneficiary till she releases a new album.",
      "conclusion": "Given the absence of an album making Rihanna an unapproved beneficiary, the Intersect Constitutional Council concludes that this treasury withdrawal proposal does not adhere to the constitutional standards set by the Cardano governance framework. \n\nAs such, the proposal is not considered constitutional and should be rejected.",
