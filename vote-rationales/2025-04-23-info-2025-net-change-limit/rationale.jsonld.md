# Summary

The Intersect Constitutional Council votes that the net change limit info action (9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9#0) is unconstitutional.

# Rationale Statement

The governance action proposes a net change limit of 350 million ada for the year 2025. This is the second info action to propose a net change limit, an off-chain parameter to establish the maximum amount of treasury withdrawals allowed for any given period, the year 2025 in this instance. A net change limit is required by TREASURY-01(a) and TREASURY-02(a) Guardrails as outlined in Appendix I Section 3.

The proposal format meets the required standards as outlined in Article III Section 5. It follows a standardised and legible format including a URL and hash of documented off-chain content. The rationale also includes a title, abstract, reason for the proposal and relevant supporting materials. On the subject of the supporting materials, it was noted that this proposal sets a high standard in this area. All provided materials are hosted via IPFS and economic models are provided in both CSV and PDF format. The provision of PDF versions help make the economic models more accessible as well as providing a snapshot of the accompanying CSV files, which could be altered or extended upon in the future.

The Council has always weighed the importance of procedural correctness along with considering the levels of verifiability and immutability of proposals and their supporting materials.

There was a potential issue raised regarding the wording of the proposal. It proposes that, “The 2025 Net Change Limit will begin at the start of Epoch 532 and continue for 72 epochs, finishing at the conclusion of Epoch 604 in December 2025”. It was noted that by including Epoch 604 up to its conclusion, as in this current wording, it would make the net change limit duration 73 epochs and not 72 epochs. It would also extend past the year 2025 and run into the first week of the year 2026.

The contradicting timelines and the ambiguity caused by not knowing which one was intended raised the question of to what extent does the Constitutional Committee have the power to make the decision regarding which one is correct based on information not contained in the proposal. We believe that making a decision on which version was intended in the text is outside of the Constitutional Committee power. The responsibility of the ambiguity created by this error lies with the proposers and therefore it should be resubmitted without errors.

The Council was able to reach out to the author of the proposal who confirmed that this was indeed a typing error and that the epoch range specified in the proposal was incorrect by one epoch. The intention of the proposed timeline was made clear by the author but they also acknowledged that the Council could consider the presence of the error enough to be an issue.

# Precedent Discussion

The Council has always weighed the importance of procedural correctness along with considering the levels of verifiability and immutability of proposals and their supporting materials. It was also highlighted that the Council should not feel pressured to let a procedural error slide in this instance because the author was Intersect and the Council represents the Intersect ICC seat. The Council has always asserted its position as an independent group of community members free from any undue influence and continues to do so.

# Counterargument Discussion

Discussions held by the Council were conflicted. The majority of members were satisfied with the constitutionality of the majority of the content and were conscious that for the most part, the proposal standard set a very high bar. The Council is also conscious of the importance of establishing a net change limit at this stage and considered any constitutional impacts that potential delays in budgets and funding for ecosystem development could have. It was considered that the proposal stating that it “facilitates a yearly budget cycle” and was to conclude in “December 2025”, could have been enough to ignore the proposed epoch timeline mismatch. Ultimately, the discussion came down to procedural correctness and to what extent the Council could allow the ambiguity caused by the proposed epoch timeline error to be permissible, irrespective of the proposer.

# Conclusion

The Council has voted unconstitutional due to the ambiguity caused by the mismatch between yearly calendar and provided epoch timeline. Should this proposal be resubmitted with the error corrected, the Council would consider it to be constitutional.
