# Summary

The Intersect Constitutional Council votes that the budget info action, “9d213a57684d7ddf6f3350c80d042639ecbed5ccccc4a05bf54959a086593e7b”, to be constitutional.

# Rationale Statement

In accordance with Article III Section 4, this budget info action is in connection with a proposed ecosystem budget and as permitted in Article IV Section 1, this proposal relates to the maintenance and future development of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem, in particular, the continued maintenance and development of Cardano governance tooling.

The proposal is submitted by the newly formed Cardano GovTool Consortium, a group of community builders currently actively developing GovTool and those who utilise GovTool infrastructure for their associated projects. It proposes a budget for 12 months of maintenance and development with a value of 1.15 million ada. This proposal supports the article for participatory and decentralized governance as outlined in the constitution (Article III).

The proposal meets the standardized and legible format requirements as outlined in Article III Section 5. The rationale contains a title, abstract, reason for the proposal and relevant supporting materials.

The proposal outlines a proposed budget breakdown and administration process, meeting Article IV Section 2 requirements and is proposed in advance of any potential treasury withdrawal request, as per Article IV Section 3 “No withdrawals from the Cardano Blockchain treasury shall be permitted unless such withdrawals have been authorized and are being made pursuant to a budget for the Cardano Blockchain that is then in effect”. The budget proposal also accounts for an allocation of funds to cover independent audits as mandated by Article IV Section 4.

# Precedent Discussion

This budget proposal had previously applied to be a part of the recently approved Intersect administered budget of 275 million ada but had failed to receive enough community approval to be included within that budget. This proposal has been revised based on community feedback from that process and has been submitted independently of the previously approved Intersect budget whilst still designating Intersect as its administrator.

The proposal is one of two budget info actions with a focus on funding governance tooling currently up for voting on-chain and which support continued access and participation for ada holders to participate in the governance process and therefore supports the constitutional rights of ada holders in this regard.

# Counterargument Discussion

While some community members have voiced concerns over the amount requested for this proposal or raised questions regarding the budget breakdown provided, the Council reiterates that its role is to assess the constitutionality of proposals and not to allow any subjective views influence their decisions, those questions fall within the remit of the DReps. As outlined in the rationale section above, this proposal meets all of its constitutional requirements for a budget info action.

# Conclusion

Upon reviewing this proposal, the Council could find no reason to consider this proposal to be unconstitutional and this is reflected in the unanimous decision to pass it as constitutional.
