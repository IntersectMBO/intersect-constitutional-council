# Summary

The Intersect Constitutional Council votes Constitutional on the Cardano Constitution.

# Rationale Statement

The governance action meets the format requirements of Article III, Section 6 of the Interim Constitution. It contains a Title, Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and a detailed list of Supporting Links, all hosted via IPFS. Most importantly, the proposed Constitution linked in the Supporting Links section is identical in content as the final off-chain version voted on in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Nairobi, Kenya in December 2024. This has been verified by comparing the hash of both documents (the submitted governance action and GIthub) using cardano-cli and also cross-referenced against first-hand photographic evidence from Buenos Aires, namely the voting results on the screens of the Convention hall. Further verifying that this was indeed the document voted on in Argentina and Kenya. That hash is: “2a61e2f4b63442978140c77a70daab3961b22b12b63b13949a390c097214d1c5”. The content of this Constitution builds upon and does not conflict with anything laid out in the Interim Constitution.

The new Cardano Constitution is a valid amendment to the Constitution as per the requirements of Article VII Section 1 (Amendments) as it has been approved by a collective decision-making process, and it will require the on-chain governance action to satisfy the applicable approval threshold.

An important question raised by Article VI Section 3 is if a new Constitution could be implemented if it violated the Interim Constitution. The Intersect Constitutional Council would note here that a guiding principle could be a form of “direct acceptance” where if a Constitution showed sufficient support per the thresholds of such a new Constitution it could be accepted even if it violated segments of the current Constitution.

Another related question is if the Constitutional Committee should wait to vote on a Constitution until it has the approval of the DReps or if it is sufficient to vote if it fulfills the current Constitutional requirements. This problem would come to surface if a new Constitution violated a current Constitution in some form. In short, regarding the currently proposed new Constitution, it is constitutional and as such waiting for the threshold is not needed.

# Precedent Discussion

This is the first time a governance action has been put forward that proposes a change to the Constitution. In this instance it proposes replacing the current “Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Interim Constitution” with the “Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution”, also referred to as the Delegate Endorsed Constitution, the process for which was proposed in Article VIII and outlined in Appendix II of the Interim Constitution.

In the process of drafting the new Constitution, 63 global workshops were held, involving 1400 workshop participants, from which 63 Delegates and 63 non-voting Alternates were elected to attend the Constitutional Convention hosted between Buenos Aires, Argentina and Nairobi, Kenya. This process satisfies Appendix II Section 1 of the Interim Constitution while the Constitutional Convention being held in December 2024 satisfied Appendix II Section 2 which stated that a Constitutional Convention must have taken place no later than the end of 2024. Finally, the 63 Delegates voted on a proposed Constitution text, which passed with 95% approval (60 “yes” votes and 3 “no” votes), which was subsequently submitted on-chain as a governance action on 30 January 2025, meeting the requirements laid out in Appendix II Section 3.

# Counterargument Discussion

As with previous governance actions submitted by Intersect, the Intersect Constitutional Council reasserts its position as an independent body of Intersect Members and Cardano Community contributors who are able to vote without undue influence on their outputs. With that being said, in this instance the Council also acknowledges the current composition of its members and their close relation to the process by which this proposed Constitution has come to be. On the Council we have Civics Committee members, a Constitutional Delegate, a Constitutional Convention host, and multiple members who attended the proceedings in both Buenos Aires, Argentina and Nairobi, Kenya, as invited members of the ICC. We acknowledge that some may view this as grounds to vote Abstain but we have also demonstrated throughout our Interim tenure that we are able to acknowledge and discuss any such potential biases and still continue to act in accordance with our role of assessing governance actions solely on their constitutionality, independently of any personal opinion or bias.

To this end, we have participated in thorough discussion between an “Abstain” and a “Constitutional” vote considering a range of pro’s and con’s including, but not limited to, potential positive optics of an “Abstain” vote within the community in the short-term, as well as potential long-term impacts. For example, what would it look like to newcomers to the ecosystem in the future if Intersect itself has not voted in favour of the Constitution that the ecosystem lives by?

# Conclusion

With the evidence presented here, the Intersect Constitutional Council views the “Cardano Constitution to Replace the Interim Constitution” governance action to be Constitutional.
