# Summary

The Intersect Constitutional Council votes that the Net Change Limit info action (7f320409d9998712ff3a3cdf0c9439e1543f236a3d746766f78f1fdbe1e06bf8#0) is unconstitutional, with a vote split of 4-x-x.

# Rationale Statement

The governance action proposes Net Change Limits for both 2025 and 2026 at 300 million ADA and 250 million ADA respectively. This is the first info action to propose a net change limit, an off-chain parameter to establish the maximum amount of treasury withdrawals allowed for any given period, in this case, the years 2025 and 2026. A Net Change Limit is required by TREASURY-01(a) and TREASURY-02(a) Guardrails as outlined in Appendix I Section 3.

The proposal appears to be a community submitted proposal rather than an institutional one and the Council commends the initiative taken, as it is any ada holders right as outlined in Article III Section 3, “All holders of ada shall have the right to propose changes”.

The proposal for the most part meets the required standards as outlined in Article III Section 5. It follows a standardised and legible format including a URL and hash of documented off-chain content. The rationale also includes a title, abstract, reason for the proposal and relevant supporting materials.

During deliberations, the Council considered the importance of, and differences between, verifiability and immutability with regards to proposals and their supporting content. In this instance, the proposal metadata was stored in a mutable format on GitHub rather than a more immutable one such as IPFS. It was debated that having a URL and hash by which any potential changes could be identified and verified did provide some level of protection from proposal alterations post-submission. However, it was noted that the very fact that the metadata anchor file was changed within the first 48 hours of the governance action being submitted, causing confusion amongst voters regarding whether or not the hashes matched, even days after it had been corrected was enough for a number of Council members to deem this proposal unconstitutional.

The Constitution states that, “All owners of ada shall have the right to ensure that the process for participating in, submitting and voting on on-chain governance actions is open and transparent and is protected from undue influence and manipulation” and the Council members who voted unconstitutional in this instance deemed the initial confusion caused by early metadata inconsistencies enough to violate this principle.

# Precedent Discussion

The Council has demonstrated a consistent emphasis on procedural correctness and constitutional compliance. Previous decisions have similarly stressed the importance of immutable and clearly documented governance actions, especially regarding budgetary controls. For example, 51f495aa23f4b3b3aa90afde4a0e67823bb7ac4ac65f5ffbb138373b863f2f74#0 was voted unconstitutional due to (deliberately) broken metadata URL and hashes, and 56f39054758f1a3cedc1de9225d66bf270b62dfdbfbc5399f1d6d43aceffc636#0 due to the mutable nature of proposed roadmap content.

# Counterargument Discussion

Consideration was given to potential ambiguity from combining two annual limits into one proposal. The Council concluded the proposal sufficiently separates and clarifies each annual limit, and found no constitutional conflict or confusion resulting from the combined submission.

The Council held in-depth discussions regarding the levels of importance between verifiability and immutability of proposals and their content. Strong arguments were made that the provided metadata anchor URL and hash could be sufficient protections against proposal manipulations post-submission. It was also raised that while the metadata and hash did change so soon after submission, it was corrected after it had been publicly acknowledged, giving voters enough time to vote again if the hash mismatch had impacted their voting decision. Ultimately though, Council members felt the incident had already brought too much disrepute to this particular proposal and the voting process for it.

# Conclusion

The Council agreed that the wording of the proposal rationale itself was constitutional. However, the voter confusion caused by the initial change in proposal metadata hash and the need to respect voters time by not making them have to vote multiple times as a result of such incidents, the majority of Council members deemed this proposal unconstitutional.

This decision reinforces the expectation for clear, immutable documentation in governance submissions, while the Council acknowledges that multi-year treasury control proposals are permissible under the constitutional framework when appropriately documented.
