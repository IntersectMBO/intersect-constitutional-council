    "summary": "The Intersect Constitutional Council votes the treasury withdrawal governance action, “60ed6ab43c840ff888a8af30a1ed27b41e9f4a91a89822b2b63d1bfc52aeec45#0”, to be constitutional.",
    "rationaleStatement": "The governance action is a treasury withdrawal action titled “Amaru Treasury Withdrawal 2025” and has been submitted following the approval of the budget info action (“bd488931f792651fefa9c6fda185a2c6cec83245b51d994e33090ce36e29cc26#0”). With regards to the standard constitutionality checks that this Council applies to all governance action types, the proposal meets the required standards of Article III Section 5. It follows a standardized and legible format, including a URL and hash of the off-chain content and provides a title, abstract, reasoning and relevant supporting materials. The content is identical to the final off-chain version of the proposal, as confirmed by the matching metadata hash.\n\nThis is the first treasury withdrawal action to be submitted on-chain and as such there is an additional check to verify a match between the withdrawal amounts put forth in the metadata and those submitted on-chain. This has been confirmed by cross-referencing the metadata with the currently live on-chain proposal, queried via the command-line, and further supports the constitutional requirement of Article III Section 5 for the proposal to be “open, transparent and protected from undue influence or manipulation”. For clarity, the 1.5 million ada requested has been divided across 5 proposed stake addresses with the values of 100,000 | 500,000, | 300,000 | 300,000 | 300,000 ada respectively.\n\nAs the first treasury withdrawal action to be submitted on-chain the majority of the constitutionality focus centred around Article IV. This treasury withdrawal action is linked to a previously approved on-chain budget info action (Article IV Section 1) and specifies a process for overseeing the use of funds from Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals including designating one or more administrators who shall be responsible for oversight (Article IV Section 2). As the first treasury withdrawal action requesting 1.5 million ada, it does not cause the Cardano Blockchain treasury balance to violate the currently applicable net change limit of 350 million ada, previously established by the approval of governance action “9b62b3c632f329016a968ac25211825bb4f84b12461121c7da3aa11df92370f9#0”. The treasury withdrawal action is also made pursuant to a budget that is in effect and that has not been deemed unconstitutional by the ICC (Article IV Section 3).\n\nThe proposal outlines in detail the intended management structure for the withdrawal funds, among which the individuals, their responsibilities and corresponding stake addresses have been provided. An allocation of ada to cover the cost of periodic independent audits and oversight is also accounted for, satisfying Article IV Section 4. It was noted that the networking funding had been secured by other means but was listed anyway for transparency. Additionally, a stake address has been provided for the management of contingency funds for dispute resolutions as mandated by Article IV Section 4.\n\nThe Constitution mandates that any treasury withdrawal funds must not be staked with an SPO and must be delegated to the predefined auto-abstain voting option (Article IV Section 5). Following a thorough check of the provided stake addresses it can be confirmed that, as of 8th July 2025, this is indeed the status of all provided addresses.\n\nLastly, the proposal satisfies the treasury guardrail TREASURY-02a, TREASURY-03a and TREASURY-04a in Appendix I Section 3. That is to say, it is made pursuant to a previously approved budget, does not exceed the net change limit and is denominated in ada.",
    "precedentDiscussion": "This is the first on-chain treasury withdrawal request in the history of the Cardano Blockchain and as such, the Council has had to apply additional checks to those that have been required to date, mainly that of assessing Article IV and ensuring continuity with the previously approved budget info action that it is connected to. The Council commends the professionalism and thoroughness of the Amaru Treasury Withdrawal 2025 proposal and would also like to highlight the increased self-imposed acknowledgement of constitutional awareness. Governance is still in its infancy on Cardano and the past several months have been a learning curve for all involved, seeing an increased self-assessment as part of the proposal, while not a constitutional requirement, is encouraging to see and bodes well for smoother governance processes going forward.\n\nAn additional “safety check” has been carried out by cross-referencing the author signatures of the metadata for both the previously approved budget info action and this proposal, which match across both proposals. While not necessarily a constitutional requirement, it does provide a useful safeguard against an imposter attempting to submit another proposal against the same budget info action.",
    "counterargumentDiscussion": "It has been noted that under the “Financial Audit” section of the proposal, while provision has been made for a financial auditor, one has yet to be appointed. However, while the constitution mandates that an administrator shall be designated as part of a budget proposal (Article IV Section 2), it does not specify the same arrangement regarding the appointment of an auditor at this stage. It only states that an allocation of ada shall be required as part of the withdrawal request to cover the cost of the audits at this stage.\n\nIn addition to this, the proposal demonstrates a history of transparency and accountability by including supporting materials linking to the audits of the proposed treasury smart contract, carried out by 2 independent auditors.",
    "conclusion": "The Intersect Constitutional Council considers this governance action to be constitutional. This detailed rationale is provided in part as a reflection of the thoroughness and professionalism of the proposal itself.",
