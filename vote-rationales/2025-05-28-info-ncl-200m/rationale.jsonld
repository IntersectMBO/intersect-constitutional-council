    "summary": "The Intersect Constitutional Council votes that the governance action (gov_action10k0unljvaej0kd89w7pn0zkgdx59c7xkl0x5q78dzvdtd73u0kmqq5xl5y5) is constitutional. This is an Info Action that proposes a 200M ADA net change limit (NCL) for the rest of 2025.",
    "rationaleStatement": "The governance action proposes a net change limit (NCL) of 200 million ada for the year 2025. The NCL is an off-chain parameter that establishes the maximum amount of treasury withdrawals permitted for a defined period. Establishing an NCL is a constitutional requirement under TREASURY-01(a) and TREASURY-02(a) guardrails, as outlined in Appendix I Section 3 of the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution.\\n\\nThe proposal format meets the required standards outlined in Article III Section 5. It includes a title, abstract, rationale, metadata anchor, hash, and supporting materials in a clear and legible format. All materials are properly linked and verifiable.\\n\\nAs an Info Action, this proposal has no direct on-chain effect and therefore cannot be vetoed by the Constitutional Committee. Nonetheless, the ICC may provide an opinion on the constitutionality of the proposed direction. Upon review, the Council determined the action complies with Article IV Section 3, enabling treasury withdrawals and supporting the operational framework for Cardano’s community-led governance.\\n\\nThis action is the first NCL proposal to proceed a previously passed NCL, in this case, a 350M ADA NCL that was accepted by a DRep and ICC majority (even though this Council deemed that particular proposal to be unconstitutional due to some proposal content inconsistencies). If approved, this proposed 200M ada NCL will override any previously proposed or approved NCL for calendar year 2025.",
    "precedentDiscussion": "This is the first time that a net change limit proposal has been submitted following a previously passed proposal and with overlapping time frames which in itself raises an issue of precedence. The Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution mandates that a DRep-approved net change limit must be agreed upon by DReps (TREASURY-01) in Appendix I Section 3. However, the net change limit is not an on-chain parameter and there are no further Guardrails pertaining to the frequency or the upper/lower bounds that a net change limit may be set to, as you might find with other blockchain parameters and guardrails within the Constitution. Which leaves such discussions open to interpretation. In this instance, the Council finds that the proposal submission meets all of the traditional Constitutional checkmarks by which we have considered all previous governance actions. The Council’s role is to assess proposals objectively up against the Constitution and not to provide a subjective assessment on whether or not it agrees with the NCL value proposed on a subjective level.",
    "counterargumentDiscussion": "There is grounds to discuss the issue of repeated and varied net change limit proposals during a short window of time. The Constitution mandates that a net change limit must be in place for a treasury balance period. With one NCL already being approved and budgets moving forward against such a precedent, any potential disruption to the development of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem caused by multiple submissions and fluctuating levels of additional NCL proposals across such a short window should be considered. It could be argued that it is disruptive to the budget process and adds unnecessary workload for already busy DReps. However, without further provisions for the frequency of NCL proposals and without any upper/lower bound limits to proposed NCL changes in the Constitution, the Council is limited in how it could objectively enforce any attempted regulation of NCL proposals on these grounds.",
    "conclusion": "The Council has voted constitutional. The proposal satisfies all formatting, procedural, and constitutional requirements. It is consistent with Articles III and IV of the Cardano Constitution, and complies with treasury guardrails.",
