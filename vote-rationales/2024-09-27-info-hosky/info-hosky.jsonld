    "summary": "The info action for calling Chang hf+1 HOSKY hard fork is constitutional.",
    "rationaleStatement": "**Understanding of facts. The format of the proposal is valid.**\nThe Intersect Council notes that the proposal is not currently fully viewable in govtools due to an unsupported formatting of metadata. This is due to a limitation with the current GovTool software. Intersect Council believes the proposal is still constitutional in terms of a valid format for the proposal. It is an info action per technical standards of CIP-1694 and article 3 section 5 of the Interim Constitution. IPFS is a standardized and legible format.The document has an url and a hash for the off chain content. It is currently not a constitutional requirement to follow a specific standard such as CIP-100 or CIP-108, and the requirements of verifying an unedited document can still be achieved with the document hash. There are currently no established routines for what supporting material is needed (if any) for the naming of a hard fork and thus the question is only if it meets the standards for a sufficient rationale as per article 3 section 6.\n**The type of info action is a poll for sentiment**\nThe Intersect Council notes that the text is worded as a proposal, thus the phrase, 'I propose.' This use of natural language indicates to the reader that the text is putting a suggestion forward for others to consider. The Intersect Council understands this info action to be a poll for community sentiment. The info action is not binding on-chain as CIP-1694. Article 3 section 5 of the Cardano Interim Constitution identifies the info action as a special type of governance action that allows community sentiment to be gauged without committing to any on-chain change. As for any subsequent governance actions and any effect of the info action on them, the Intersect Council notes there is no specific mentioning of requirements for naming of hard forks in the Interim Constitution. It is up to the community to establish such processes or define them in a future Constitution. \n**The role of the Constitutional Committee is not to express its sentiment towards info action but their constitutionality**\nAnother question raised about the facts is if the info action is a poll for sentiment, does that sentiment polling also extend to the Constitutional Committee itself? Article 6 section 1 expresses that 'The Constitutional Committee shall be limited to voting on the constitutionality of governance actions.' It is therefore the understanding of the Intersect Council that if an info action is a poll for sentiment it is not asking members of the CC to offer their personal opinions on the merits of the question but whether the proposed action would be constitutional or not.\n**Rationale to participate in the governance action**\nAny governance action submitted to ada holders for approval requires the standards set in article 3 section 6 to be upheld and would be unconstitutional if not. The Intersect Council believes they should judge the info action on the constitutionality of this article. One reason for this is to ensure that info actions are used as the intended method of gauging community sentiment as per article 3 section 5. For example one could risk not upholding the standards in article 3 section 6 of governance if the council abstained from voting on the constitutionality of info actions that were purely commercial advertisements without any rationale, and especially so if there were multiple such info actions making it harder for the community to read and digest community sentiment gauging info actions.\n**Rationale to vote Yes on the governance action**\nThe issue for the Intersect Council is to determine sufficient rationale for an info action sentiment poll on naming a hard fork for it to be constitutional.\n**A minimal standard of sufficient for all governance actions related to the Cardano Blockchain in article 3 section 6.**\nA natural language interpretation of “Sufficient rationale shall be provided to justify the requested change to the Cardano Blockchain.” in article 3 section 6 means this standard relates to actual on-chain changes to the Cardano Blockchain itself.\nHowever a wider interpretation has a more pragmatic merit in that all actions related to the Cardano Blockchain that has any effect on the blockchain, should have sufficient standards related to the governance action type. For example if the naming of a hard fork is seen as damaging the legitimacy of the info action for example “torture person X”, or seen as damaging the intended function of the info action as a method of gauging sentiment it might violate such a wider interpretation. Because of this even when no technical or process standards are established there are still minimal constitutional standards a governance action should be tested against.\n**Info actions that could have effect on further governance actions**\nThere is an example in the Interim Constitution for treasury withdrawals where in the appendix I section 3 treasury-04 where a threshold of 50% for active stake of DReps voting yes is required for a budget for treasury withdrawals to be able to be ratified. This threshold could be reached by a previous info action on a budget and is an example of an info action having an effect for a subsequent governance action as it could be used for the requirement in the treasury-04 guardrail. In terms of this being a requirement for the naming of a hard fork there is no regulation on the process in the Interim Constitution, and thus there is no higher threshold or standard other than any minimum standards such as discussed above.\n**The rationale given is sufficient**\nIn the proposal the rationale given is 'Saying Chang-1, Chang-2, Chang+1 is confusing for users and media. Call the next hard fork HOSKY Hard Fork for the sake of clarity.'\nThis meets minimum standards for an info action as the name proposed is not seen as damaging the legitimacy of the info action or violating the intended function of the info action. There are no technical standards this naming proposal needs to fulfill. There are currently no established routines for any thresholds of info actions binding future governance actions related to naming hard forks in the Interim Constitution. There is also no established process giving requirements for type of arguments or rationale for such an info action of a hard fork name.\nBased on this it is concluded that the rationale given is sufficient.",
    "precedentDiscussion": "Hard forks, development phases, and ledger eras on Cardano have traditionally been named with consent of the entities who held the genesis keys of the network. Two recent hard forks have been named after a community member in memory of Vasil Stoyanov Dabov or Cardano researchers in memory of Phil Chang. The process for naming hard forks during participatory governance has not been established, or decided if there should be a formal process for it or not.",
    "counterargumentDiscussion": "Establishing the bounds of the CC is of utmost importance. CIP-1694 goes further than the current constitution in saying,'Though it cannot be enforced on-chain, the constitutional committee is only supposed to vote on the constitutionality of governance actions (which should thus ensure the long-term sustainability of the blockchain) and should be replaced (via the no confidence action) if they overstep this boundary. Said differently, there is a social contract between the constitutional committee and the actors of the network. Although the constitutional committee could reject certain governance actions (by voting 'No' on them), they should only do so when those governance actions are in conflict with the Constitution.'\nWhile this governance action is not “unconstitutional” and therefore undeserving of a “No” vote by the Intersect Council, it is reasonable to take the position that it is “non-constitutional” in the fact that it does not apply to the operations of the Cardano network. The naming of Hard Forks is an informal practice that has generally been done by the developers for marketing purposes.  There is no on-chain mechanism where the “name” matters, so there is nothing to consider regarding constitutionality.  Whether or not the development team calls it “Chang” or “Hosky” and whether or not members of the Community follow suit does not affect the blockchain.\nBased on these facts, there is no reason that the question in this poll needs to be answered. It is possible that a non-vote would be a reasonable course of action. However, it may be prudent to actively vote “Abstain” to signal neutrality to the community.",
