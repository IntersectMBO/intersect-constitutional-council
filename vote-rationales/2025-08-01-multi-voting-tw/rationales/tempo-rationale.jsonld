    "summary": "The Intersect Constitutional Council votes that the budget info action, “495bd3cd44ea6bc0b4c2dbb1e4cdc7e214874c2c07490a4e2476a627ef911280#0”, to be constitutional.",
    "rationaleStatement": "In accordance with Article III Section 4, this budget info action is in connection with a proposed ecosystem budget and as permitted in Article IV Section 1, this proposal relates to the maintenance and future development of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem, in particular, the continued maintenance and development of Cardano governance tooling.\n\nThe proposal is submitted by the team from Tempo.Vote, a community team that has built out their own governance tooling to help ada holders participate in decentralised governance. It provides a platform that ada holders can use either as an alternative to, or in conjunction with other existing tools like GovTool, reducing reliance on a single platform. It proposes a budget for 6 months of maintenance and development with a value of 380,000 ada, divided across infrastructure and development costs. This proposal supports the article for participatory and decentralized governance as outlined in the constitution (Article III).\n\nThe proposal meets the standardized and legible format requirements as outlined in Article III Section 5. The rationale contains a title, abstract, reason for the proposal but does not provide any relevant supporting materials beyond a link to the selfdriven website within the rationale section text. Proposal metadata is hosted using IPFS storage and has a matching metadata hash.\n\nThe proposal provides a simple budget breakdown, stating that the 380,000 ada would be divided across 2 areas, 200,000 ada for infrastructure costs and 180,000 ada for development costs. It indicates that funds would be administered by selfdriven, meeting Article IV Section 2 requirements and is proposed in advance of any potential treasury withdrawal request, as per Article IV Section 3 “No withdrawals from the Cardano Blockchain treasury shall be permitted unless such withdrawals have been authorized and are being made pursuant to a budget for the Cardano Blockchain that is then in effect”.",
    "precedentDiscussion": "This is the latest in a recent series of budget info actions and one of two currently up for voting that relate specifically to the funding of maintenance and development for governance tools.\n\nIn the past, this Council has deemed proposal(s) as unconstitutional where typos have caused procedural ambiguity. Most notably for this proposal, is the misspelling of “Cardano” as “Cardono” in the title. While purely a typo in this instance and not of concern regarding procedural clarity and constitutionality, the Council highly encourages governance action proposers to take extra care when submitting proposals in the future, especially when committing a 100,000 ada deposit for up to 30 days at a time.\n\nThis is the first budget info action to name selfdriven as a potential administrator. While the proposal provides little detail beyond naming them as an administrator with a link to their website, a check of the selfdriven website did reveal details related to “Cardano Governance Treasury Withdrawal Administration / 3rd Party Assurer” under a “Specialist Services” section. The Council does feel that providing such information as part of the proposal text itself would have been beneficial for the proposal.",
    "counterargumentDiscussion": "Following an initial phase of Cardano governance where the community, governance action proposers, DReps and ICC members were all “finding their feet”, developing processes and establishing expected standards, the Council feels that recent proposals have begun to set a certain standard. This proposal is the first one in a while where there has been some diversion of opinion for this Council. While voting 4-2-1 in favour of constitutionality, some members felt that this particular proposal fell short in a few areas. \n\nArguments against have included over-simplification, lack of supporting materials and a lack of provided administration and auditing processes. While the constitution lists “relevant supporting materials” as a minimum requirement in Article III Section 5 this Council has considered in the past that if a proposal is detailed enough then it is understood that this may not always be necessary, however, one member felt that having to look up additional information via the selfdriven website regarding their administration process could have been better served by inclusion in the proposal text itself. The website did provide a useful administration flow chart but the “Information & Fees structure for this service” link only loaded 1 of 5 pages of the associated pdf file. Secondly, the budget breakdown was considered by some as lacking in detail and could have benefitted from a more detailed breakdown.\n\nOther arguments put forth for unconstitutionality were that the budget proposal does not “specify a process for overseeing use of funds from Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals” as mandated by Article IV Section 2, beyond simply naming selfdriven as an administrator and did not specify “an allocation of ada as a part of such funding request to cover the cost of periodic independent audits and the implementation of oversight metrics as to the use of such ada” as mandated by Article IV Section 4. However, it was also argued that the selfdriven website provided information regarding the administration process and that the ada allocation for audits applied more to any subsequent treasury withdrawal action rather than to the initial budget info action.",
