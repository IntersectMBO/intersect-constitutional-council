The info action for calling Chang hf+1 HOSKY hard fork is constitutional.

# Rationale Statement

**Understanding of facts. The format of the proposal is valid.**
The Intersect Council notes that the proposal is not currently fully viewable in govtools due to an unsupported formatting of metadata. This is due to a limitation with the current GovTool software. Intersect Council believes the proposal is still constitutional in terms of a valid format for the proposal. It is an info action per technical standards of CIP-1694 and article 3 section 5 of the Interim Constitution. IPFS is a standardized and legible format.The document has an url and a hash for the off chain content. It is currently not a constitutional requirement to follow a specific standard such as CIP-100 or CIP-108, and the requirements of verifying an unedited document can still be achieved with the document hash. There are currently no established routines for what supporting material is needed (if any) for the naming of a hard fork and thus the question is only if it meets the standards for a sufficient rationale as per article 3 section 6.
**The type of info action is a poll for sentiment**
The Intersect Council notes that the text is worded as a proposal, thus the phrase, 'I propose.' This use of natural language indicates to the reader that the text is putting a suggestion forward for others to consider. The Intersect Council understands this info action to be a poll for community sentiment. The info action is not binding on-chain as CIP-1694. Article 3 section 5 of the Cardano Interim Constitution identifies the info action as a special type of governance action that allows community sentiment to be gauged without committing to any on-chain change. As for any subsequent governance actions and any effect of the info action on them, the Intersect Council notes there is no specific mentioning of requirements for naming of hard forks in the Interim Constitution. It is up to the community to establish such processes or define them in a future Constitution. 
**The role of the Constitutional Committee is not to express its sentiment towards info action but their constitutionality**
Another question raised about the facts is if the info action is a poll for sentiment, does that sentiment polling also extend to the Constitutional Committee itself? Article 6 section 1 expresses that 'The Constitutional Committee shall be limited to voting on the constitutionality of governance actions.' It is therefore the understanding of the Intersect Council that if an info action is a poll for sentiment it is not asking members of the CC to offer their personal opinions on the merits of the question but whether the proposed action would be constitutional or not.
**Rationale to participate in the governance action**
Any governance action submitted to ada holders for approval requires the standards set in article 3 section 6 to be upheld and would be unconstitutional if not. The Intersect Council believes they should judge the info action on the constitutionality of this article. One reason for this is to ensure that info actions are used as the intended method of gauging community sentiment as per article 3 section 5. For example one could risk not upholding the standards in article 3 section 6 of governance if the council abstained from voting on the constitutionality of info actions that were purely commercial advertisements without any rationale, and especially so if there were multiple such info actions making it harder for the community to read and digest community sentiment gauging info actions.
**Rationale to vote Yes on the governance action**
The issue for the Intersect Council is to determine sufficient rationale for an info action sentiment poll on naming a hard fork for it to be constitutional.
**A minimal standard of sufficient for all governance actions related to the Cardano Blockchain in article 3 section 6.**
A natural language interpretation of “Sufficient rationale shall be provided to justify the requested change to the Cardano Blockchain.” in article 3 section 6 means this standard relates to actual on-chain changes to the Cardano Blockchain itself.
However a wider interpretation has a more pragmatic merit in that all actions related to the Cardano Blockchain that has any effect on the blockchain, should have sufficient standards related to the governance action type. For example if the naming of a hard fork is seen as damaging the legitimacy of the info action for example “torture person X”, or seen as damaging the intended function of the info action as a method of gauging sentiment it might violate such a wider interpretation. Because of this even when no technical or process standards are established there are still minimal constitutional standards a governance action should be tested against.
**Info actions that could have effect on further governance actions**
There is an example in the Interim Constitution for treasury withdrawals where in the appendix I section 3 treasury-04 where a threshold of 50% for active stake of DReps voting yes is required for a budget for treasury withdrawals to be able to be ratified. This threshold could be reached by a previous info action on a budget and is an example of an info action having an effect for a subsequent governance action as it could be used for the requirement in the treasury-04 guardrail. In terms of this being a requirement for the naming of a hard fork there is no regulation on the process in the Interim Constitution, and thus there is no higher threshold or standard other than any minimum standards such as discussed above.
**The rationale given is sufficient**
In the proposal the rationale given is 'Saying Chang-1, Chang-2, Chang+1 is confusing for users and media. Call the next hard fork HOSKY Hard Fork for the sake of clarity.'
This meets minimum standards for an info action as the name proposed is not seen as damaging the legitimacy of the info action or violating the intended function of the info action. There are no technical standards this naming proposal needs to fulfill. There are currently no established routines for any thresholds of info actions binding future governance actions related to naming hard forks in the Interim Constitution. There is also no established process giving requirements for type of arguments or rationale for such an info action of a hard fork name.
Based on this it is concluded that the rationale given is sufficient.

# Precedent Discussion

Hard forks, development phases, and ledger eras on Cardano have traditionally been named with consent of the entities who held the genesis keys of the network. Two recent hard forks have been named after a community member in memory of Vasil Stoyanov Dabov or Cardano researchers in memory of Phil Chang. The process for naming hard forks during participatory governance has not been established, or decided if there should be a formal process for it or not.

# Counterargument Discussion

Establishing the bounds of the CC is of utmost importance. CIP-1694 goes further than the current constitution in saying,'Though it cannot be enforced on-chain, the constitutional committee is only supposed to vote on the constitutionality of governance actions (which should thus ensure the long-term sustainability of the blockchain) and should be replaced (via the no confidence action) if they overstep this boundary. Said differently, there is a social contract between the constitutional committee and the actors of the network. Although the constitutional committee could reject certain governance actions (by voting 'No' on them), they should only do so when those governance actions are in conflict with the Constitution.'
While this governance action is not “unconstitutional” and therefore undeserving of a “No” vote by the Intersect Council, it is reasonable to take the position that it is “non-constitutional” in the fact that it does not apply to the operations of the Cardano network. The naming of Hard Forks is an informal practice that has generally been done by the developers for marketing purposes.  There is no on-chain mechanism where the “name” matters, so there is nothing to consider regarding constitutionality.  Whether or not the development team calls it “Chang” or “Hosky” and whether or not members of the Community follow suit does not affect the blockchain.
Based on these facts, there is no reason that the question in this poll needs to be answered. It is possible that a non-vote would be a reasonable course of action. However, it may be prudent to actively vote “Abstain” to signal neutrality to the community.

# Conclusion

The rationale given meets the minimum standards of the Interim Constitution for a rationale for an info action. The Intersect Council believes that the info action is constitutional.

**Understanding of facts**
 **The format of the proposal is valid**
 It is an info action per technical standards of CIP-1694 and article 3 section 5 of the Interim Constitution. The Interim constitution does not directly say there is a requirement for the language a governance action is given in, but Article 3 section 6 suggests any governance action should require standardized and legible format including an URL and hash linked to documented off chain content. The info action uses the @language tag as per the CIP-0100 and is otherwise also standardized and in a legible...

# Counterargument Discussion

While there is nothing wrong with using an Info Action to make a declaration, it appears that this issue is not “constitutional” in nature.  Therefore, while this governance action is not “unconstitutional” and therefore undeserving of a “No” vote by the Intersect Council, it is reasonable to take the position that it is “non-constitutional” in the fact that it does not apply to the operations of the Cardano network.  It in fact declares itself to be purely an action of sentiment.
 There may be future declarations like this proposed as Info Actions.  Some of them may be controversial and express values that not all members of the Cardano community agree with.  In these cases, it may be tempting for members of the Constitutional Committee to attempt to divine from the Constitution whether or not the declaration is in line with Cardano’s values.  Therefore it may be wise to consider Abstaining from all such votes.

The info action is constitutional.

The info action “Should K increased?” is not constitutional due to not having sufficient rationale to justify the action. 

# Rationale Statement

**Understanding of facts**

 **The format of the proposal**
 It is an info action per technical standards of CIP-1694 and article 3 section 5 of the Interim Constitution.

 **Regarding the wording of K-parameter**
 While the K parameter has long-been discussed amongst the Cardano community, it should be noted that the particular parameter to which it historically referred is now officially known as stakePoolTargetNum within the Interim Constitution guardrails section (Appendix I: Section 2.4). While this in itself may or may not affect the constitutionality of the info action, it does raise an educational opportunity. “stakePoolTargetNum” is a more accessible parameter name for wider ecosystem participants to unde...

 **The info action as the Intersect Council understands it**
 The info action informs of the proposer's understanding of the K and a0 parameter. It is stated to “by no means a suggestion of what Cardano protocol parameters should be modified to or if they should be modified at this time. The goal of this governance action is to increase governance participation before the next hardfork”. However the title of the proposal is a question if K should be increased: “Should K increased?”. The Intersect Council interprets this to be that the proposal does not state what ...

 **The supporting material is not sufficient**
 Article 6 section 3 covers any governance action submitted to Ada holders for approval and has standards in terms of sufficient rationale to justify “requested change to the Cardano Blockchain” and with a minimum a title, abstract, reason for the proposal, and relevant supporting materials.  In this case the info action asks “Should K increased?” does not include sufficient relevant supporting material per the opinion of the Intersect Council as the provided supporting material is A) a link to Atrium la...

 Rationale: 

 **Does the info action fulfill the requirements in the constitution?**
 The action is an info action gauging sentiment. In this case in regards to governance participation and related to K and a0, so it fulfills the requirements in article 3 section 5 of being an info action for community sentiment gauging.

 The info action only partially fulfills the standards in article 3 section 6 for all governance actions. It is in a standardized and legible format and includes a url and a hash linked to a document off-chain. However, the supporting material is not relevant and not suf...

 Given that the info action only partially fulfills the requirements in article 3 section 6 it is not constitutional.

 The Intersect Council notes we only vote on the constitutionality of the rationale not being sufficient, and have not supported or gone against any increase or decrease in K(stakePoolTargetNum).

 **A discussion of the intent of info actions and standards related to info actions being  tools for community sentiment**
 As discussed in the Intersect Councils rationale for governance action 15f82a365bdee483a4b03873a40d3829cc88c048ff3703e11bd01dd9e035c916#0 (Hosky HF) the Intersect Council believes there are minimum standards to info actions. To quote our previous rationale:  “For example one could risk not upholding the standards in article 3 section 6 of governance if the council abstained from voting on the constitutionality of info actions that were purely commercial advertisements without any rationale, and especiall...

 We believe by ensuring that info actions have sufficient rationales and are not seen as pure commercial advertisements we ensure the integrity of the info action as a community sentiment gauging tool and that in turn promotes effective governance. The Intersect Council also share the sentiment of the Cardano Foundations rationale in their no vote on the action 7fd6429add8f2611ad8d48c0cc49101463093aec285faea402e8cfde78ea58d7#0 (“Should K increased?”) where they highlight article 1 section 1 to uphold tran...

 The Intersect Council would also highlight the opportunity for the community to refine info actions as community sentiment gauges with off-chain discussions in the various tools online before submitting for the entire Cardano community on-chain. By promoting a culture of such discussions we ensure that on-chain governance is transparent and where community sentiment is done at a stage when the community is informed on a topic thus promoting effective governance. Polls related to changing protocol paramet...

# Precedent Discussion

The Cardano community has a long tradition in debating protocol parameters, such as through the Cardano Foundation forums before any proposed changes, and also with a tradition for further research on what the community identifies as important protocol parameters to change. Historically the K-parameter has been under review by the community and discussion has included implications of K-parameter changes.

The info action “Should K increased?” is not constitutional.

The Intersect Council votes the proposed protocol parameter update unconstitutional due to missing rationale and without correct changes intended by the proposal.

# Rationale Statement

**Understanding of facts**
 The protocol parameter change governance action is a proposal to modify plutus V3 cost models as per the title of the proposal “Plutus V3 Cost Model Parameter Changes Prior to Chang#2” however the rationale in the anchored file is no longer to be found. It is the Intersect Councils impression that due to an error the protocol changes were submitted on a node v9 and this meant that the node discarded proposed changes that would have been included with a node v10. Due to this error it was decided to rem...

 Rationale:
 The question is if a protocol parameter change proposal that is not as intended by the proposer is a constitutional proposal?

 Article 3 section 6 paragraph 2 reads that “Any governance action proposal reaching the on-chain governance stage shall be identical in content as to the final off-chain version of such governance action proposal.”

 In this case the action proposed included cost model parameter changes while the version put on-chain would not be identical to the intended off-chain version. The Intersect Council believes that the intent of how the final off-chain version should look like matters for the interpretation of what is the final off-chain version. One of this paragraphs functions is to ensure that there is no mismatch between what is proposed and what ends up as the final off-chain version. Here in effect nothing is propo...

 Also due to the rationale being changed a question becomes if an on purpose removed rationale makes a proposal unconstitutional?

 Article 3 section 6 paragraph 1 reads that “Any governance action submitted to Ada holders for approval shall require a standardized and legible format including a URL and hash linked to documented off-chain content. Sufficient rationale shall be provided to justify the requested change to the Cardano Blockchain. The rationale shall include, at a minimum, a title, abstract, reason for the proposal, and relevant supporting materials.”

 In this case the documented off-chain content was removed. As in our understanding of the facts section this was likely done to remove confusion in what proposal to vote for. In general a removed off-chain document will likely make a proposal unconstitutional but there could be circumstances such as a last minute bug when the community had all read the supporting documents that could in theory make a proposal still valid. One of the intents of not having a change can be read in the last paragraph of the ...

 **A small note of independence**
 Due to this being the first time Intersect is submitting a governance action the Intersect Council notes we as a council will vote strictly based on the constitutionality of governance actions including those from Intersect. The Intersect Constitutional Council is a separate body from the Technical Steering Committee who requested this parameter change to be put forward.

The Intersect Council votes the protocol parameter change unconstitutional due to missing rationale and changes not as the intent of the proposal.

# Rationale Statement

**Understanding of facts** The proposal is of the Protocol Parameter Update Governance Action type. It is a proposal to update the Plutus V3 Cost Model to enable new Plutus primitives in Protocol Version 10. It is the Intersect Constitutional Council’s understanding that the proposal has been recommended by the Intersect Parameter Committee (see https://forum.cardano.org/t/oct-10-2024-voltaire-era-parameter-committee-intermediate-state/137361) and subsequently ratified unanimously by the Intersect Techni...

 The Parameter Update states that existing on-chain settings will not be changed by this action and that the proposed changes only apply to the enabling of new primitives that will become available following the next hard fork, without this update, the new primitives will not be available for use.

 **The format of the proposal**
 The Protocol Parameter Update (b2a591ac219ce6dcca5847e0248015209c7cb0436aa6bd6863d0c1f152a60bc5#0) is a resubmission of a previous Protocol Parameter Update action (51f495aa23f4b3b3aa90afde4a0e67823bb7ac4ac65f5ffbb138373b863f2f74#0). As a result of the previous action containing a submission error, the on-chain / off-chain metadata was intentionally broken to discourage any votes in favour of the proposal.

 This updated submission is a thorough proposal that now satisfies the requirements laid out in Artic...

 **The content of the proposal**
 The Protocol Parameter Update action states that this proposal does not make any changes to existing chain parameter settings but proposes additions to the already existing Plutus V3 Cost Model in order to make new primitives available for use in Protocol Version 10. It should be noted that this proposal is also dependent on the next hard fork as a result. While this proposal may be ratified prior to the next hard fork, the primitives only become available following the change to Protocol Version 10. Th...

 **Technical review**
 While the Intersect Constitutional Council would usually prefer to seek out external expert opinion on technical proposals such as this one, the multiple supporting links provided in this instance have been deemed to provide enough corroborating sources to make a sufficient cross-referenced analysis of the proposal’s security and viability.

 **A small note on independence**
 While the governance action in question has been submitted by the Technical Steering Committee at Intersect, the Intersect Constitutional Council is an independent body consisting of community members separate from Intersect employees. Following on from internal discussions during the early months of its formation, the Council continues to evaluate and assert its independence during its weekly meetings. As such, the Intersect Constitutional Council is comfortable providing a Constitutional verdict on th...

The Intersect Constitutional Council votes the action to be Constitutional.

# Rationale Statement

The proposal is an Info Action governance type. It is a proposal to name the next Cardano hard fork the “Plomin Hard Fork” in memory of Cardano community contributor Matthew Plomin.

The Intersect Constitutional Council has determined that the proposal meets the required standards defined in Article III section 6 of the Interim Constitution: it follows a standardized and legible format and provides an Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Supporting Links.

Additionally, the proposal aligns with the Cardano Interim Constitution’s principles:

1. Recognition of Contributions: The proposal honors a valued community member, aligning with Article II, Section 4, which encourages acknowledging contributions.
2. Participatory Governance: The proposal provides clear justification, adhering to Article III, Section 6, which requires transparency and rationale for governance actions.
3. Alignment with Principles: The name change does not compromise technical performance, security, or decentralization, respecting Article I tenets.

By fostering inclusivity and trust, this proposal reflects Cardano’s community-driven ethos and is therefore deemed constitutionally sound.

However, it is crucial to reiterate that this particular governance action was inspired by the recent passing of a beloved community member, and as such, it is emotionally charged with tremendous community sentiment. With this in mind, the Intersect Constitutional Council must emphasize that its role is to assess the constitutionality of a proposal and **not** the sentiment behind it.

While individual members rightly have their own personal feelings on the subject, this Council aims to remain impartial to the best of its abilities when assessing this Info Action.

Considering that the Chang hard fork was initially planned as a single event but divided into two phases for practical reasons, it is determined that the legacy of Chang was respected and honored. Furthermore, in keeping with the tradition of honoring prominent members of the Cardano community through the naming of hard forks, Matthew Plomin, as a distinguished member of the Cardano community, is appropriately recognized with such honors.

Should the community decide on this matter through an on-chain vote, it would mark the first instance in which the naming of a hard fork is determined in a decentralized manner.

Finally, it is worth highlighting the independence of this Council as the GA was proposed by the Intersect Hard Fork Working Group.

# Precedent Discussion

This council has set precedence with regards to Info Actions relating to the naming of hard forks after voting that the very first governance action, the Hosky hard fork Info Action, was constitutional. While this initial GA was the first of its kind and contained some errors, the current GA is an improvement and has been submitted free of any technical errors and, as previously mentioned, meets the standards laid out in Article III, section 6, Article II, Section 4, and the tenets of Article I.

Hard forks, development phases, and ledger eras on Cardano have traditionally been named with consent of the entities who held the genesis keys of the network. Two recent hard forks have been named in memory of Cardano Community members: Vasil Stoyanov Dabov and Phil Chang.

Additionally, it is imperative to note that the process for naming hard forks during participatory governance has not yet been established and no formal process has been decided upon. However, the Intersect Constitutional Council is mindful that we are establishing a precedent for the Cardano ecosystem and this could be the beginnings of a formalized process.

This Council has already established its own precedent regarding voting on Info Actions pertaining to the naming of hard forks, as the first mainnet governance action (15f82a365bdee483a4b03873a40d3829cc88c048ff3703e11bd01dd9e035c916#0) proposed naming the upcoming hard fork “Hosky.”

A majority of the Intersect Constitutional Council voted “Constitutional” in that instance, thus recognizing the authority of the Cardano community to take such an action through on-chain governance.

# Counterargument Discussion

As previously outlined in the Council’s rationale counterargument discussion in the 15f82a365bdee483a4b03873a40d3829cc88c048ff3703e11bd01dd9e035c916#0 “Hosky” governance action, the same counter argument can be raised here for the Plomin Hard Fork proposal.

While this governance action is not “Unconstitutional” and therefore undeserving of a “No” vote by the Intersect Constitutional Council, it is reasonable to take the position that this GA is “non-constitutional” because it does not apply to the operations of the Cardano network.

The naming of hard forks is an informal practice that has generally been done by the developers for marketing purposes. There is no on-chain mechanism where the “name” matters, so there is nothing to consider regarding constitutionality. Era names are defined at the ledger level, with the most recent eras being “Babbage” and “Conway,” which have not followed the name of a hard fork since the Alonzo hard fork. Therefore, in this instance the choice of hard fork name does not affect the Cardano blockchain.

Based on this line of reasoning, it is possible that a non-vote would be a logical course of action. However, it may be prudent to actively vote “Abstain” to signal neutrality to the community.

# Conclusion

The rationale given meets the minimum standards of the Interim Constitution for a rationale for an info action. The Intersect Council believes that the info action is Constitutional.

The Intersect Constitutional Council votes the Plomin hard fork action to be constitutional.

# Rationale Statement

The proposal is a hard fork governance action. It is a proposal to hard fork to Protocol Major Version 10 and Minor Version 0 named the “Plomin” hard fork. Its intent is for all 7 governance actions in CIP-1694 to be enabled, and it will affect the withdrawal of staking rewards by allowing it only after delegation to a DRep (including the pre-defined abstain/no-confidence options).

The hard fork should only be valid after INTERIM-01 of having had sufficient time for DReps to register and campaign, at least 18 epochs and and it needs to pass the HARDFORK-XX guardrails in particular HARDFORK-04 “At least 85% of stake pools by active stake should have upgraded to a Cardano node version that is capable of processing the rules associated with the new protocol version.”

As the Intersect Constitutional Council understands the facts during the governance action proposal period a new node version (10.1.4) has been introduced that is meant to mitigate a risk of a potential DoS attack following the hard fork according to the release notes.

**These facts raises a principle question if the HARDFORK-04 of at least 85% of stake pools should be upgrade requires a node version that does not introduce a security risk in the network after the hard fork.**

The language of the guardrail in HARDFORK-04 itself is silent on this, it simply says that the node version is capable of processing the rules associated with the new protocol version.

The most relevant article in the Interim Constitution is the article 3 section 6 paragraph 3 that highlights the requirement of sufficient technical review and scrutiny mandated by the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails to ensure that the governance actions does not endanger the security, functionality or performance of the Cardano Blockchain. Here we see that the Guardrails are intended to protect against security issues as one of their functions. This is also highlighted in the introduction to the guardrails “...

# Precedent Discussion

Cardano has a long history of hard forks without interruption to the blockchain through the hard fork Combinator technology that was first proven from Byron to Shelley hard fork in July 2020 and as an example the Goguen hard fork in September 2021. In all of these hard forks metrics where gathered in terms of ecosystem readiness and if it was safe to hard fork. This is a long tradition Cardano has in terms of ensuring that it is safe for the blockchain to transition and upgrade its technology and is refle...

The Intersect Constitutional Council votes Constitutional on the Cardano Constitution.

# Rationale Statement

The governance action meets the format requirements of Article III, Section 6 of the Interim Constitution. It contains a Title, Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and a detailed list of Supporting Links, all hosted via IPFS. Most importantly, the proposed Constitution linked in the Supporting Links section is identical in content as the final off-chain version voted on in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Nairobi, Kenya in December 2024. This has been verified by comparing the hash of both documents (the submitt...

# Precedent Discussion

This is the first time a governance action has been put forward that proposes a change to the Constitution. In this instance it proposes replacing the current “Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Interim Constitution” with the “Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution”, also referred to as the Delegate Endorsed Constitution, the process for which was proposed in Article VIII and outlined in Appendix II of the Interim Constitution.

In the process of drafting the new Constitution, 63 global workshops were held, involving 1400 workshop participants, from which 63 Delegates and 63 non-voting Alternates were elected to attend the Constitutional Convention hosted between Buenos Aires, Argentina and Nairobi, Kenya. This process satisfies Appendix II Section 1 of the Interim Constitution while the Constitutional Convention being held in December 2024 satisfied Appendix II Section 2 which stated that a Constitutional Convention must have...

# Counterargument Discussion

As with previous governance actions submitted by Intersect, the Intersect Constitutional Council reasserts its position as an independent body of Intersect Members and Cardano Community contributors who are able to vote without undue influence on their outputs. With that being said, in this instance the Council also acknowledges the current composition of its members and their close relation to the process by which this proposed Constitution has come to be. On the Council we have Civics Committee members...

# Rationale Statement

In order to clear up any ambiguity, it should be noted that the parameter in question has 3 different names depending on where it is found. It is tau in the Shelley Genesis file, treasury_growth_rate in db-sync and treasuryCut in cardano-cli and the Constitution Guardrails.

# Precedent Discussion

The Council has already once deemed a governance action with insufficient rationale to be deemed unconstitutional during their vote on the “K increase” Info Action (GA003). It has also previously voted on a Parameter Update, the  Plutus V3 Cost Model. Here, mismatching metadata hashes on the first submission resulted in an unconstitutional vote while the correction led to a Constitutional vote. The proposal that was voted Constitutional in this instance did include the mandated recovery/reversion plan.

# Counterargument Discussion

A wide range of arguments have been considered by the Council, as is evident by the close nature of the voting split. It was acknowledged that the proposal met many other Constitutional requirements. The rationale follows a standardised and legible format and contains a title, abstract, reason for the proposal and relevant supporting materials satisfying those elements of Article III Section 5. It also meets the requirements of the treasuryCut Guardrails (TC-01 through TC-05) as laid out in Appendix I Se...

# Conclusion

The close nature of the discussions surrounding this governance action proposal is reflected in the narrow vote split of 4-3 on the side of unconstitutional. The Council has discussed a wide range of topics but has ultimately tried to keep the final decision making process focussed solely on its remit of determining constitutionality when put up against the Constitution document and refrained from, as much as possible, diverging into evaluating broader economic impacts on the treasury. Members wishing t...

The Intersect Constitutional Council votes that the roadmap vision Info Action governance action gov_action12meeq4r43udremwpm6fzt4nt7fctvt0ah7798x036m2r4nhlccmqqhmr9wx (56f39054758f1a3cedc1de9225d66bf270b62dfdbfbc5399f1d6d43aceffc636#0) is not constitutional, with a vote split of 4-0-1.

# Rationale Statement

The governance action proposes an Info Action to gather sentiment from DReps on the Product Committee’s proposed 2025 Cardano roadmap and long-term vision. The roadmap outlines strategic priorities and development initiatives intended to guide ecosystem direction and inform future governance and funding activities.

While the proposal is non-binding, the Council recognizes the importance of such sentiment-gathering mechanisms as part of the broader democratic process. The Council supports efforts to consult the community early on significant initiatives. However, the submission’s reliance on mutable documentation rais...

# Precedent Discussion

The Council has previously flagged mutable documentation as a material concern, including in the Treasury Tax and Plutus V3 Cost Model parameter update proposals. This determination reinforces the emerging standard that all governance actions, including Info Actions, should be accompanied by complete immutable documentation to ensure their constitutionality.

# Counterargument Discussion

Some members noted that Info Actions are non-binding and may be held to a different standard than binding governance actions. However, the Constitution does not distinguish between action types in its expectations for transparency and accountability. The Council believes that sentiment-gathering actions must adhere...

# Conclusion

The Council finds this Info Action to be not constitutional due to the absence of complete immutable documentation. The content of the proposal, as submitted and reviewed on March 25, 2025, was not found to contain anything unconstitutional. However, because it cannot be guaranteed that the referenced material will remain unchanged, the Council cannot confirm the constitutionality of the action as a whole.

This decision reflects the Council’s position that all governance actions should include complete...

The Intersect Constitutional Council votes that the net change limit info action (7f320409d9998712ff3a3cdf0c9439e1543f236a3d746766f78f1fdbe1e06bf8#0) is unconstitutional after 6 of 7 members voted.

# Rationale Statement

The governance action proposes net change limits for both 2025 and 2026 at 300 million ada and 250 million ada respectively. This is the first info action to propose a net change limit, an off-chain parameter to establish the maximum amount of treasury withdrawals allowed for any given period, in this case, the years 2025 and 2026. A net change limit is required by TREASURY-01(a) and TREASURY-02(a) Guardrails as outlined in Appendix I Section 3.

The proposal appears to be a community submitted proposal rather than an institutional one and the Council commends the initiative taken, as it is any ada holders right as outlined in Article III Section 3, “All holders of ada shall have the right to propose changes”.

The proposal for the most part meets the required standards as outlined in Article III Section 5. It follows a standardised and legible format including a URL and hash of documented off-chain content. The rationale also includes a title, abstract, reason for the proposal and relevant supporting materials.

During deliberations, the Council considered the importance of, and differences between, verifiability and immutability with regards to proposals and their supporting content. In this instance, the proposal metadata was stored in a mutable format on GitHub rather than a more immutable one such as IPFS. It was debated that having a URL and hash by which any potential changes could be identified and verified did provide some level of protection from proposal alterations post-submission. However, it was noted...

# Precedent Discussion

The Council has demonstrated a consistent emphasis on procedural correctness and constitutional compliance. Previous decisions have similarly stressed the importance of immutable and clearly documented governance actions, especially regarding budgetary controls. For example, 51f495aa23f4b3b3aa90afde4a0e67823bb7ac4ac65f5ffbb138373b863f2f74#0 was voted unconstitutional due to (deliberately) broken metadata URL and hashes, and 56f39054758f1a3cedc1de9225d66bf270b62dfdbfbc5399f1d6d43aceffc636#0 due to th...

# Counterargument Discussion

Consideration was given to potential ambiguity from combining two annual limits into one proposal. The Council concluded the proposal sufficiently separates and clarifies each annual limit, and found no constitutional conflict or confusion resulting from the combined submission.

The Council held in-depth discussions regarding the levels of importance between verifiability and immutability of proposals and their content. Strong arguments were made that the provided metadata anchor URL and hash could be sufficient protections against proposal manipulations post-submission. It was also raised that while the metadata and hash did change so soon after submission, it was corrected after it had been publicly acknowledged, giving voters enough time to vote again if the hash mismatch had i...

# Conclusion

The Council agreed that the wording of the proposal rationale itself was constitutional. However, the voter confusion caused by the initial change in proposal metadata hash and the need to respect voters time by not making them have to vote multiple times as a result of such incidents, the majority of Council members deemed this proposal unconstitutional.

This decision reinforces the expectation for clear, immutable documentation in governance submissions, while the Council acknowledges that multi-year treasury control proposals are permissible under the constitutional framework when appropriately documented.

# Rationale Statement

The governance action proposes a net change limit of 350 million ada for the year 2025. This is the second info action to propose a net change limit, an off-chain parameter to establish the maximum amount of treasury withdrawals allowed for any given period, the year 2025 in this instance. A net change limit is required by TREASURY-01(a) and TREASURY-02(a) Guardrails as outlined in Appendix I Section 3.

The proposal format meets the required standards as outlined in Article III Section 5. It follows a standardised and legible format including a URL and hash of documented off-chain content. The rationale also includes a title, abstract, reason for the proposal and relevant supporting materials. On the subject of the supporting materials, it was noted that this proposal sets a high standard in this area.

# Precedent Discussion

The Council has always weighed the importance of procedural correctness along with considering the levels of verifiability and immutability of proposals and their supporting materials. It was also highlighted that the Council should not feel pressured to let a procedural error slide in this instance because the author was Intersect and the Council represents the Intersect ICC seat. The Council has always asserted its position as an independent group of community members free from any undue influence and ...

# Counterargument Discussion

Discussions held by the Council were conflicted. The majority of members were satisfied with the constitutionality of the majority of the content and were conscious that for the most part, the proposal standard set a very high bar. The Council is also conscious of the importance of establishing a net change limit at this stage and considered any constitutional impacts that potential delays in budgets and funding for ecosystem development could have. It was considered that the proposal stating that it “fac...

# Conclusion

The Council has voted unconstitutional due to the ambiguity caused by the mismatch between yearly calendar and provided epoch timeline. Should this proposal be resubmitted with the error corrected, the Council would consider it to be constitutional.

The Intersect Constitutional Council votes that the governance action (gov_action10k0unljvaej0kd89w7pn0zkgdx59c7xkl0x5q78dzvdtd73u0kmqq5xl5y5) is constitutional. This is an Info Action that proposes a 200M ADA net change limit (NCL) for the rest of 2025.

# Rationale Statement

The governance action proposes a net change limit (NCL) of 200 million ada for the year 2025. The NCL is an off-chain parameter that establishes the maximum amount of treasury withdrawals permitted for a defined period. Establishing an NCL is a constitutional requirement under TREASURY-01(a) and TREASURY-02(a) guardrails, as outlined in Appendix I Section 3 of the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution.

The proposal format meets the required standards outlined in Article III Section 5. It includes a title, abstract, rationale, metadata anchor, hash, and supporting materials in a clear and legible format. All materials are properly linked and verifiable.

As an Info Action, this proposal has no direct on-chain effect and therefore cannot be vetoed by the Constitutional Committee. Nonetheless, the ICC may provide an opinion on the constitutionality of the proposed direction. Upon review, the Council determined the action complies with Article IV Section 3, enabling treasury withdrawals and supporting the operational framework for Cardano’s community-led governance.

This action is the first NCL proposal to proceed a previously passed NCL, in this case, a 350M ADA NCL that was accepted by a DRep and ICC majority (even though this Council deemed that particular proposal to be unconstitutional due to some proposal content inconsistencies). If approved, this proposed 200M ada NCL will override any previously proposed or approved NCL for calendar year 2025.

# Precedent Discussion

This is the first time that a net change limit proposal has been submitted following a previously passed proposal and with overlapping time frames which in itself raises an issue of precedence. The Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution mandates that a DRep-approved net change limit must be agreed upon by DReps (TREASURY-01) in Appendix I Section 3. However, the net change limit is not an on-chain parameter and there are no further Guardrails pertaining to the frequency or the upper/lower bounds that a ...

# Counterargument Discussion

There is grounds to discuss the issue of repeated and varied net change limit proposals during a short window of time. The Constitution mandates that a net change limit must be in place for a treasury balance period. With one NCL already being approved and budgets moving forward against such a precedent, any potential disruption to the development of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem caused by multiple submissions and fluctuating levels of additional NCL proposals across such a short window should be con...

# Conclusion

The Council has voted constitutional. The proposal satisfies all formatting, procedural, and constitutional requirements. It is consistent with Articles III and IV of the Cardano Constitution, and complies with treasury guardrails.

The Intersect Constitutional Council votes that the budget info action, “bd488931f792651fefa9c6fda185a2c6cec83245b51d994e33090ce36e29cc26#0”, to be constitutional.

# Rationale Statement

In accordance with Article III Section 4, this “info” action is in connection with a proposed ecosystem budget and as permitted in Article IV Section 1, this proposal relates to the maintenance and future development of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem.
 
The proposal meets the standardized and legible format requirements as outlined in Article III Section 5. The rationale contains a title, abstract, reason for the proposal and relevant supporting materials, meeting the minimum requirements of Article III S...

The proposal outlines proposed budget administration processes, meeting Article IV Section 2 requirements and is proposed in advance of any potential treasury withdrawal request, as per Article IV Section 3 “No withdrawals from the Cardano Blockchain treasury shall be permitted unless such withdrawals have been authorized and are being made pursuant to a budget for the Cardano Blockchain that is then in effect”. The budget proposal also accounts for an allocation of funds to cover independent audits as ...

The proposal is well written and makes excellent use of markdown and while this may not be a Constitutional requirement, its use and the impact of making such a technical proposal more readable does so in keeping with the ethos of open and accessible governance. The proposal even provides supporting material in 2 languages.

# Precedent Discussion

This is the first submission of a proposed budget following a number of net change limits proposals and while outside of what has to-date largely been an Intersect process, the Constitution does establish an expectation of the Cardano Community to periodically propose one or more budgets in Article IV Section 1.

# Counterargument Discussion



# Conclusion

The Intersect Constitutional Council considers this to be an extremely well formatted budget info action that meets all the requirements of the Constitution and so votes constitutional.

Although the proposal meets the standards for a normal “info” action, that is to say that it provides a title, abstract, rationale and supporting links as well as a matching URL and hash of the off-chain content, it falls short in a number of areas as it pertains to a budget info action. A budget info action also needs to contain some additional content including information regarding the potential budget administrator (Article IV Section 2) and an allocation of funds requested for audits (Article IV Sect...

# Precedent Discussion

This proposal appears to have been submitted by the proposer, on behalf of other projects and as a sidecar to the current ongoing Intersect process. That is to say that it names Intersect as the administrator, as they are currently going through a broader budget process, but it has not sought permission from Intersect to do so. In failing to seek Intersect permission to be named here, it falls short of the requirement of appointing an administrator. Both parties should be actively involved in such a pr...

It should also be noted that this is the first time that  budget info action has duplicated budget proposals that were intended to be submitted elsewhere in another separate proposal. This poses a question regarding the duplication of budget proposals and the constitutionality surrounding “double-dipping” treasury withdrawal requests. At this point in time, there appears to be no guardrails in the Constitution that would make this unconstitutional and as a result would be left to the discretion of the DRe...

# Counterargument Discussion



# Conclusion

The Intersect Constitutional Council concludes that this budget info action is unconstitutional. A budget info action should have the acknowledgement and permission of all those involved, especially when it could be linked to a future treasury withdrawal. Simply naming an administrator does not meet the Constitutional requirement of appointing an administrator if it is done so without their consent.

# Rationale Statement

There was an error during the submission of this proposal that meant that the hash of the provided proposal metadata did not match. The proposer has already acknowledged this and has expressed an intention to resubmit the proposal in the future. Therefore, due to failing to meet Article III Section 5 “The content of every on-chain governance action must be identical to the final off-chain version of the proposed action”, the Council votes unconstitutional on this action without further deliberation.

# Counterargument Discussion



# Conclusion

The Intersect Constitutional Council votes this budget info action to be unconstitutional. In voting unconstitutional on this proposal due to the mismatching hash, the Council is in keeping with previous votes where such instances have occurred, for example, the first Protocol Parameter Update for the Plutus V3 Cost Model (tx hash “cdd57a0cd3d7d5eb538dfe711278857650e22f136963d481600d1634293bf434”).

The Intersect Constitutional Council votes that the net change limit info action, “637e3c256da9c1350847ca3211e8c44e3660a4471e8b6f68a8c537746b4aeb73#0”, to be constitutional.

# Rationale Statement

The net change limit info action adjusts the currently approved net change limit (NCL) window from January-December 2025 and proposes a 12-month duration from June 2025 to June 2026 in order to account for the time already passed in 2025. It is a proposal to set the net change limit to 300 million ada. Due to the fact that no treasury withdrawals have taken place against the currently approved net change limit, this makes evaluating this revision slightly more straightforward than if the ecosystem were ...

# Precedent Discussion

As this is now the fourth net change limit proposal in a short space of time, questions have been raised regarding what is acceptable with regards to the frequency and time frames in which a new NCL can be proposed. Currently, there are no guardrails in the Constitution to control the number of proposals in any given time frame or how future proposals may interact with previous ones.

# Counterargument Discussion

The Council would like to raise a minor point regarding the provision of IPFS links in governance actions. It is recommended that a neutral IPFS link be provided with a governance action proposal rather than a specified gateway as it can cause difficulties with accessing the correct metadata during the course of a governance actions lifetime. However, this is not a constitutional requirement and more of a recommendation for future proposals.

# Conclusion

The Intersect Constitutional Council votes that the 300M ada net change limit info action is constitutional.

# Rationale Statement

In accordance with Article III Section 4, this budget info action is in connection with a proposed ecosystem budget and as permitted in Article IV Section 1, this proposal relates to the maintenance and future development of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem.

The proposal is submitted on behalf of Intersect and the Cardano Budget Committee and proposes a Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget of 275,269,340 ada with a duration of 73 epochs spanning from the date that it is approved, should it be approved. This i...

The proposal meets the standardized and legible format requirements as outlined in Article III Section 5. The rationale contains a title, abstract, reason for the proposal and relevant supporting materials.

# Precedent Discussion

This is the first budget info action of this size to ever be submitted. It establishes a clear timeline duration and represents a potential budget of 275 million ada, within the currently active net change limit of 350 million ada. The proposal does acknowledge the fluid nature of Cardano governance and in particular the value set for the net change limit and provides an explanation of the potential impact on treasury withdrawals against this particular budget should the net change limit change dur...

# Counterargument Discussion

While some questions have been raised about the extent of the off-chain processes that have been employed to inform this proposal, the Council does note that the Constitution does provide provision for this in Article III Section 6, as mentioned previously.

# Conclusion

The Intersect Constitutional Council considers this budget info action to be Constitutional. It is a thoroughly thought out submission, informed by a multi-stage off-chain process involving the Cardano community and proposes robust safeguards for any future treasury withdrawals and fund management requirements on any withdrawals made against this budget should it pass.

# Rationale Statement

The governance action is a treasury withdrawal action titled “Amaru Treasury Withdrawal 2025” and has been submitted following the approval of the budget info action (“bd488931f792651fefa9c6fda185a2c6cec83245b51d994e33090ce36e29cc26#0”).

# Precedent Discussion

This is the first on-chain treasury withdrawal request in the history of the Cardano Blockchain and as such, the Council has had to apply additional checks to those that have been required to date, mainly that of assessing Article IV and ensuring continuity with the previously approved budget info action that it is connected to. The Council commends the professionalism and thoroughness of the Amaru Treasury Withdrawal 2025 proposal and would also like to highlight the increased self-imposed acknowledgem...

# Counterargument Discussion

It has been noted that under the “Financial Audit” section of the proposal, while provision has been made for a financial auditor, one has yet to be appointed. However, while the constitution mandates that an administrator shall be designated as part of a budget proposal (Article IV Section 2), it does not specify the same arrangement regarding the appointment of an auditor at this stage. It only states that an allocation of ada shall be required as part of the withdrawal request to cover the cost of the...

# Conclusion

The Intersect Constitutional Council considers this governance action to be constitutional. This detailed rationale is provided in part as a reflection of the thoroughness and professionalism of the proposal itself.

# Precedent Discussion

This budget proposal had previously applied to be a part of the recently approved Intersect administered budget of 275 million ada but had failed to receive enough community approval to be included within that budget. This proposal has been revised based on community feedback from that process and has been submitted independently of the previously approved Intersect budget whilst still designating Intersect as its administrator.

The proposal is one of two budget info actions with a focus on funding ...

# Counterargument Discussion

While some community members have voiced concerns over the amount requested for this proposal or raised questions regarding the budget breakdown provided, the Council reiterates that its role is to assess the constitutionality of proposals and not to allow any subjective views influence their decisions, those questions fall within the remit of the DReps. As outlined in the rationale section above, this proposal meets all of its constitutional requirements for a budget info action.

# Conclusion

Upon reviewing this proposal, the Council could find no reason to consider this proposal to be unconstitutional and this is reflected in the unanimous decision to pass it as constitutional.

# 

**\`Summary (300 character limit)\`**  
The Intersect Constitutional Council votes that the budget info action, “495bd3cd44ea6bc0b4c2dbb1e4cdc7e214874c2c07490a4e2476a627ef911280\#0”, to be constitutional.

**\`rationaleStatement\`**  
In accordance with Article III Section 4, this budget info action is in connection with a proposed ecosystem budget and as permitted in Article IV Section 1, this proposal relates to the maintenance and future development of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem, in particular, the continued maintenance and development of Cardano governance tooling.  
   
The proposal is submitted by the team from Tempo.Vote, a community team that has built out their own governance tooling to help ada holders participate in decentralised governance. It provides a platform that ada holders can use either as an alternative to, or in conjunction with other existing tools like GovTool, reducing reliance on a single platform. It proposes a budget for 6 months of maintenance and development with a value of 380,000 ada, divided across infrastructure and development costs. This proposal supports the article for participatory and decentralized governance as outlined in the constitution (Article III).  
   
The proposal meets the standardized and legible format requirements as outlined in Article III Section 5\. The rationale contains a title, abstract, reason for the proposal but does not provide any relevant supporting materials beyond a link to the selfdriven website within the rationale section text. Proposal metadata is hosted using IPFS storage and has a matching metadata hash.

The proposal provides a simple budget breakdown, stating that the 380,000 ada would be divided across 2 areas, 200,000 ada for infrastructure costs and 180,000 ada for development costs. It indicates that funds would be administered by selfdriven, meeting Article IV Section 2 requirements and is proposed in advance of any potential treasury withdrawal request, as per Article IV Section 3 “No withdrawals from the Cardano Blockchain treasury shall be permitted unless such withdrawals have been authorized and are being made pursuant to a budget for the Cardano Blockchain that is then in effect”.

**\`precedentDiscussion\`**  
This is the latest in a recent series of budget info actions and one of two currently up for voting that relate specifically to the funding of maintenance and development for governance tools.

In the past, this Council has deemed proposal(s) as unconstitutional where typos have caused procedural ambiguity. Most notably for this proposal, is the misspelling of “Cardano” as “Cardono” in the title. While purely a typo in this instance and not of concern regarding procedural clarity and constitutionality, the Council highly encourages governance action proposers to take extra care when submitting proposals in the future, especially when committing a 100,000 ada deposit for up to 30 days at a time.

This is the first budget info action to name selfdriven as a potential administrator. While the proposal provides little detail beyond naming them as an administrator with a link to their website, a check of the selfdriven website did reveal details related to “Cardano Governance Treasury Withdrawal Administration / 3rd Party Assurer” under a “Specialist Services” section. The Council does feel that providing such information as part of the proposal text itself would have been beneficial for the proposal.

**\`counterArgumentDiscussion\`**  
Following an initial phase of Cardano governance where the community, governance action proposers, DReps and ICC members were all “finding their feet”, developing processes and establishing expected standards, the Council feels that recent proposals have begun to set a certain standard. This proposal is the first one in a while where there has been some diversion of opinion for this Council. While voting 3-2-2 in favour of constitutionality, some members felt that this particular proposal fell short in a few areas. 

Arguments against have included over-simplification, lack of supporting materials and a lack of provided administration and auditing processes. While the constitution lists “relevant supporting materials” as a minimum requirement in Article III Section 5 this Council has considered in the past that if a proposal is detailed enough then it is understood that this may not always be necessary, however, one member felt that having to look up additional information via the selfdriven website regarding their administration process could have been better served by inclusion in the proposal text itself. The website did provide a useful administration flow chart but the “Information & Fees structure for this service” link only loaded 1 of 5 pages of the associated pdf file. Secondly, the budget breakdown was considered by some as lacking in detail and could have benefitted from a more detailed breakdown.

Other arguments put forth for unconstitutionality were that the budget proposal does not “specify a process for overseeing use of funds from Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals” as mandated by Article IV Section 2, beyond simply naming selfdriven as an administrator and did not specify “an allocation of ada as a part of such funding request to cover the cost of periodic independent audits and the implementation of oversight metrics as to the use of such ada” as mandated by Article IV Section 4\. However, it was also argued that the selfdriven website provided information regarding the administration process and that the ada allocation for audits applied more to any subsequent treasury withdrawal action rather than to the initial budget info action. 

**\`Conclusion\`**  
The Intersect Constitutional Council has voted constitutional, with a vote split of 3-2-2.

The Intersect Constitutional Council votes the treasury withdrawal governance action **“2c7f900b7ff68f317a7b0e42231d4aed36227660baf2ee9a4be7e880eb977313#0”** to be **constitutional**.

# Rationale Statement

During the assessment of the 39 treasury withdrawal governance actions it became clear that a template has been used, with identical sections repeated across all 39 while each individual proposal contained their own vendor/project-specific sections within. It was therefore identified that the majority of the constitutional alignment was satisfied by the templated sections and while each individual proposal has been assessed for completeness, the Council reiterates its role is to assess the constitutiona...

# Precedent Discussion

Following the previously approved and enacted on-chain treasury withdrawal action, the first in the history of the Cardano Blockchain, the Council has applied the same additional checks that we applied then, mainly that of assessing Article IV and ensuring continuity with the previously approved budget info action that they are connected to.

The additional “safety check” has also been carried out by cross-referencing the author signatures for each of the proposals with those disclosed by Intersect in...

# Counterargument Discussion

As stated in previous vote rationales, the Intersect Constitutional Council continues to assert its’ independence from Intersect as an institution. This was particularly demonstrated when the Council voted a previous Intersect proposal as unconstitutional due to a perceived procedural error. Therefore, although the 39 treasury withdrawal proposals have been submitted by Intersect, this Council is comfortable enough in its independence to still be able to vote on these proposals without undue influence.

# Conclusion

The Intersect Constitutional Council considers this treasury withdrawal action to be Constitutional.

The Intersect Constitutional Council votes the treasury withdrawal governance action **“2c7f900b7ff68f317a7b0e42231d4aed36227660baf2ee9a4be7e880eb977313#0”** to be **constitutional**.

# Rationale Statement

During the assessment of the 39 treasury withdrawal governance actions it became clear that a template has been used, with identical sections repeated across all 39 while each individual proposal contained their own vendor/project-specific sections within. It was therefore identified that the majority of the constitutional alignment was satisfied by the templated sections and while each individual proposal has been assessed for completeness, the Council reiterates its role is to assess the constitutiona...

# Precedent Discussion

Following the previously approved and enacted on-chain treasury withdrawal action, the first in the history of the Cardano Blockchain, the Council has applied the same additional checks that we applied then, mainly that of assessing Article IV and ensuring continuity with the previously approved budget info action that they are connected to.

The additional “safety check” has also been carried out by cross-referencing the author signatures for each of the proposals with those disclosed by Intersect in...

# Counterargument Discussion

As stated in previous vote rationales, the Intersect Constitutional Council continues to assert its’ independence from Intersect as an institution. This was particularly demonstrated when the Council voted a previous Intersect proposal as unconstitutional due to a perceived procedural error. Therefore, although the 39 treasury withdrawal proposals have been submitted by Intersect, this Council is comfortable enough in its independence to still be able to vote on these proposals without undue influence.

# Conclusion

The Intersect Constitutional Council considers this treasury withdrawal action to be Constitutional.

The Intersect Constitutional Council votes the treasury withdrawal governance action **“2c7f900b7ff68f317a7b0e42231d4aed36227660baf2ee9a4be7e880eb977313#0”** to be **constitutional**.

# Rationale Statement

During the assessment of the 39 treasury withdrawal governance actions it became clear that a template has been used, with identical sections repeated across all 39 while each individual proposal contained their own vendor/project-specific sections within. It was therefore identified that the majority of the constitutional alignment was satisfied by the templated sections and while each individual proposal has been assessed for completeness, the Council reiterates its role is to assess the constitutiona...

# Precedent Discussion

Following the previously approved and enacted on-chain treasury withdrawal action, the first in the history of the Cardano Blockchain, the Council has applied the same additional checks that we applied then, mainly that of assessing Article IV and ensuring continuity with the previously approved budget info action that they are connected to.

The additional “safety check” has also been carried out by cross-referencing the author signatures for each of the proposals with those disclosed by Intersect in...

# Counterargument Discussion

As stated in previous vote rationales, the Intersect Constitutional Council continues to assert its’ independence from Intersect as an institution. This was particularly demonstrated when the Council voted a previous Intersect proposal as unconstitutional due to a perceived procedural error. Therefore, although the 39 treasury withdrawal proposals have been submitted by Intersect, this Council is comfortable enough in its independence to still be able to vote on these proposals without undue influence.

# Conclusion

The Intersect Constitutional Council considers this treasury withdrawal action to be Constitutional.

The Intersect Constitutional Council votes the treasury withdrawal governance action **“2c7f900b7ff68f317a7b0e42231d4aed36227660baf2ee9a4be7e880eb977313#0”** to be **constitutional**.

# Rationale Statement

During the assessment of the 39 treasury withdrawal governance actions it became clear that a template has been used, with identical sections repeated across all 39 while each individual proposal contained their own vendor/project-specific sections within. It was therefore identified that the majority of the constitutional alignment was satisfied by the templated sections and while each individual proposal has been assessed for completeness, the Council reiterates its role is to assess the constitutiona...

# Precedent Discussion

Following the previously approved and enacted on-chain treasury withdrawal action, the first in the history of the Cardano Blockchain, the Council has applied the same additional checks that we applied then, mainly that of assessing Article IV and ensuring continuity with the previously approved budget info action that they are connected to.

The additional “safety check” has also been carried out by cross-referencing the author signatures for each of the proposals with those disclosed by Intersect in...

# Counterargument Discussion

As stated in previous vote rationales, the Intersect Constitutional Council continues to assert its’ independence from Intersect as an institution. This was particularly demonstrated when the Council voted a previous Intersect proposal as unconstitutional due to a perceived procedural error. Therefore, although the 39 treasury withdrawal proposals have been submitted by Intersect, this Council is comfortable enough in its independence to still be able to vote on these proposals without undue influence.

# Conclusion

The Intersect Constitutional Council considers this treasury withdrawal action to be Constitutional.

Therefore, although the 39 treasury withdrawal proposals have been submitted by Intersect, this Council is comfortable enough in its independence to still be able to vote on these proposals without undue influence.

# Conclusion

The Intersect Constitutional Council considers this treasury withdrawal action to be Constitutional.

Following the previously approved and enacted on-chain treasury withdrawal action, the first in the history of the Cardano Blockchain, the Council has applied the same additional checks that we applied then, mainly that of assessing Article IV and ensuring continuity with the previously approved budget info action that they are connected to.

Following the previously approved and enacted on-chain treasury withdrawal action, the first in the history of the Cardano Blockchain, the Council has applied the same additional checks that we applied then, mainly that of assessing Article IV and ensuring continuity with the previously approved budget info action that they are connected to.

The additional “safety check” has also been carried out by cross-referencing the author signatures for each of the proposals with those disclosed by Intersect in...

# Counterargument Discussion

As stated in previous vote rationales, the Intersect Constitutional Council continues to assert its’ independence from Intersect as an institution. This was particularly demonstrated when the Council voted a previous Intersect proposal as unconstitutional due to a perceived procedural error. Therefore, although the 39 treasury withdrawal proposals have been submitted by Intersect, this Council is comfortable enough in its independence to still be able to vote on these proposals without undue influence.

# Conclusion

The Intersect Constitutional Council considers this treasury withdrawal action to be Constitutional.

With the correction of the on-chain requested amount to match the 5 million ada requested in the proposal, this action also further meets the requirement that “the content of every on-chain governance action must be identical to the final off-chain version of the proposed action” from Article III Section 5.

As stated in the Council’s previous action rationale the provided treasury withdrawal stake address was also not delegated to an SPO and DRep delegation was moved to abstain later on August 2 2025 at 18:13:19 (UTC+1) having initially been delegated to a DRep at 13:14:12. At the time of writing this rationale the withdrawal address currently meets the conditions laid out in Article IV Section 5.

**\`Summary (300 character limit)\`**  
The Intersect Constitutional Council votes to abstain on the “Update Constitution” governance action, “207b226e110e13bb18b119fcd313520e0fcd060b2bc9fb9a5e5bc6e94ab10f3b\#0”.

**\`rationaleStatement\`**  
At the end of this epoch 578 of the Cardano blockchain, it appears that the “Update Constitutional Committee” governance action (“47a0e7a4f9383b1afc2192b23b41824d65ac978d7741aca61fc1fa16833d1111\#0”) will be ratified and subsequently enacted at the boundary of epoch 579/580. The Intersect Constitutional Council acknowledges the likelihood that their vote here will be recorded, although ultimately not counted following the enactment of the new committee on-chain prior to the expiration or enactment of this “Update Constitution” governance action, and so records this vote to chain as a formality and as our last act as Interim Constitutional Committee members.

**\`precedentDiscussion\`**  
This is the first “Update Constitution” governance action to be submitted following the enactment of the first community-ratified Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution at the start of 2025\. The Interim Constitution being replaced at that time outlined a specific process for the creation and ratification of the community-approved constitution. The current Constitution provides much less structured requirements for the amendment process in Article VIII and as such leaves open the possibility for much more subjective interpretation. The Council has tried its best to remain objective in its approach and we outline the areas of our discussions in the counter argument discussion section below.

This is also the first governance action to have its govActionLifetime span two sides of an “Update Constitutional Committee” governance action. As such it appears as though any vote submitted by an outgoing Constitutional Committee member shall be recorded on-chain but ultimately not counted once the Constitutional Committee update has been enacted on-chain. At the time of the writing of this rationale, it would appear that there will be one epoch remaining for this “Update Constitution” governance action where it will fall under the purview of the newly-elected Constitutional Committee. As such, this vote is primarily submitted for the purpose of records.

**\`counterArgumentDiscussion\`**  
During discussions surrounding the constitutionality of updating the Constitution, topics covered included but were not limited to:

- Socialisation \- What level of community input is required for legitimacy? Which forums are deemed “appropriate”? (Article VIII Section 1\)  
- Content \- Does the new wording remove any previous safeguards in any way?  
- Scale \- When does an amendment become considered a wholesale rewrite? What precedent would be set by approving large scale changes?  
- Frequency \- How often should the Constitution be amended and what impact does frequent updates have upon the legitimacy of the Constitution?  
- Technical \- Does the updated text conform to CIP-120 which outlines a specification for the Constitution text (found here: [https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0120/README.md](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0120/README.md)) and would deviation from this spec impact current tooling with regards to correctly displaying the Constitution text? Do any of the Guardrail text alterations impact any technical settings or are they merely textual alterations?  
- Role of the ICC/CC \- Some members felt that evaluating the constitutionality of a Constitution update to be an unusual role for the ICC/CC to carry out, given that their role is to enforce the currently active constitution and felt that voting on such actions would be better suited to DReps and SPOs, much like the “Update Constitutional Committee” action, allowing for a maximum level of legitimacy for any community-approved Constitution.

**\`Conclusion\`**  
As our last act as the Intersect Constitutional Council we would like to thank Intersect for the opportunity to carry out this role. As community members selected to fulfill the duties of what is often seen as an “institutional” seat, we have to acknowledge the level of independence that Intersect has allowed us to operate with, none more so than when we were even allowed to vote against an Intersect-submitted governance action. It has been an experience and an honour in this most foundational year for Cardano on-chain governance. Thank you all.

The Intersect Constitutional Council votes to abstain on this governance action.
